In 2010 I was intrigued about getting XBee mesh networks connected to twitter, it seemed to be the thing to do. As a result, I ended up purchasing an iDigi connectPort X4 starter kit, it came with an ethernet to XBee bridge and some indoor and outdoor temperature sensor.

The [result](https://github.com/clokey/PublicCode/tree/master/bushey_monitor) is a small piece of Python, using the excellent BeautifulSoup, that responded to peoples requests for temperatures. As with the other code in the public repo, I am sure that the twitter api, no longer supports this interaction, but is here for pedagogic purposes.
