It's been a little over 5 years since I committed a great quantity of code to open source. A lot has changed since the
and the time is right to bring the code together on my github pages.

The plan is that as I migrate code over, I'll update this blog and provide links into the repository.

First up, Mac OS X Virtual Serial ports, a project that provided a wrapper around the socat command line tool
and has been broken for at least 2 releases of Mac OS X. I am not necessarily proposing fixing it right now, but at least bring bring it to github first.

Onwards.
