Now that I have some time on my hands, I've decided to become more Ninja like with my keyboard fu. To that end I have thrown myself into using [Alfred 2.0](http://alfredapp.com) a lot more. There are a whole host of really useful workflows published on the [Packal](http://www.packal.org/) site and there are a large number of articles on useful and good workflows, that have really kicked started my used of Alfred.

I have also written my own workflow that binds ctrl+cmd+alt+F to toggle the functionality of the 'fn' key on an Apple keyboard. Everytime the shortcut is executed it toggles the behaviour from default apple behaviour to *naked* functionality and vice-versa.

I have published the workflow on [Packal](http://www.packal.org/workflow/toggle-function-keys) as well as put it my [PublicCode github repo](https://github.com/clokey/PublicCode/tree/master/AlfredWorkflows)
